        <h3>What are codes and ciphers?</h3>
        <p>Codes and ciphers are methods of obscuring information. Codes and ciphers, while often used synonymously, are two different things.<br>A code is a system where one word or phrase represents another word or phrase. For example, in a code, "SURROUND THE ENEMY TROOPS" could be transmitted as "A GIANT GUMMY LIZARD". Both the sender and the recipient would know the true meaning of the message.<br>A cipher is a system where one letter represents another. Take the Atbash cipher, where A = Z, Z = A, B = Y, Y = B, etc. "HELLO" would be transmitted as "SVOOL". Both parties would know how to decode the cipher, so the message would get through.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How are ciphers decrypted?</h3>
        <p>The Atbash cipher is an unusual one in that it doesn't require a key to decrypt. Most ciphers require both a message and a key to reveal the true meaning. Cryptanalysts try to decode ciphers while knowing only the message, not the key or how it was encrypted. The field of cryptanalysis was a critical one in World War II as the Allies attempted to decode Germany's "Enigma code".</p>
