        <h3>Decrypting the Enigma</h3>
        <p>Like the Vigen&egrave;re, the Enigma is difficult to decrypt because it involves a great many settings. There are over fifteen billion <i>billion</i> possible keys for the Engima, which resulted in it taking two years for the Allies to decrypt. Due to the complexity of the Enigma, there is no example on this page. However, you likely were unable to find the key for the Vigen&egrave;re cipher. Decoding the Enigma was even more difficult than the Vigen&egrave;re because the Allies didn't know <i>how</i> the Enigma was encoded, only how to input a key and a message and receive deciphered text. Decoding ciphers with many possible keys is extremely challenging, and the Enigma could only be decoded by analyzing frequency of words. For more information on how the Enigma was finally decrypted, check out the board!</p>
